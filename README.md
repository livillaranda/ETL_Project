# ETL_Project - Pro Sports by City 

## Proposal 

We decided to investigate the wins, losses, ties, and win percentage for the four major sport leagues: NBA, NFL, NHL, and MBA.  We also gather information from the US Census on the population of major cities in 2010, the last year of the census.  We gathered data on all the sport leagues for 2010 as well, to combine information on the cities the teams are in.  

## Data 

After deciding to use city population data along with the sports data, we picked 2010 as that is the last year of the US Census with information on all cities.  Then, we found data for the sport leagues for the same year.  Here are links to the data sources we used:

## Cleaning the Data 
Overall 

### NBA Data

### MLB Data 

### NFL Data 

### NHL Data 


## Database Work 
creating ERD, then creating schema in PostgreSQL (tables, foreign keys to cities), adding in data 

## Successful Database - Tested by Queries
